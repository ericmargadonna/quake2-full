# Quake 2 Volley Ball Mod
This was created (attepmted) for Game Mod Development, Spring 2022 at NJIT. None of 
the Volley Ball features work because I was way too short for time. But hey, this
readme is worth 10% of the grade! Maybe you, the humble reader, could complete what
I could not. Or not, either way below is how to go about trying this out and/or
changing it yourself.

## How-To
This code can be cloned, modified and built with Visual Studio if you're into that
sorta thing however there is [another repo](https://github.com/ericmargadonna/QVBModFolder) that has this version built already.

If you decide to edit the code, you have to build 'game' in the project and move
the output gamex86.dll into a folder alongside your baseq2 folder. Then your mod
can be launched via shortcut, or from within Quake 2 itself.

If you just want to run the code here as is, visit that [other repo](https://github.com/ericmargadonna/QVBModFolder).
Clone it, move the Quake Volley Ball folder into your Quake 2 game folder 
(alongside the baseq2 folder) and run the included shortcut. 

Voila, you are now running my Quake 2 Mod!

## A Message from John Carmack
### This was included with the Quake 2 Source Code

This is the complete source code for Quake 2, version 3.19, buildable with
visual C++ 6.0.  The linux version should be buildable, but we haven't
tested it for the release.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
GPL.

All of the Q2 data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the 
original terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if 
you do a true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on 
this code.

Thanks to Robert Duffy for doing the grunt work of building this release.
